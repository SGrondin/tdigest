   [Tdigest.create ?delta ?k ?cx ()]

   [~delta:Discrete] switches off TDigest behavior and treats the distribution as discrete, with no merging and exact values reported.

   [Tdigest.add ?n ~data td]

   Incorporate a value ([data]) having count [n] (default: [1]) into a new Tdigest.
*)
val add: ?n:int -> data:float -> t -> t

(**
   [Tdigest.add_list ?n ll td]

   Incorporate a list of values each having count [n] (default: [1]) into a new Tdigest.
*)
val add_list: ?n:int -> float list -> t -> t

(**
   [Tdigest.p_rank td q]
   For a value [q] estimate the percentage ([0..1]) of values [<= q].

   Returns a new Tdigest to reuse intermediate computations.
*)
val p_rank: t -> float -> t * float option

(**
   Same as [Tdigest.p_rank] but for a list of values.

   Returns a new Tdigest to reuse intermediate computations.
*)
val p_ranks: t -> float list -> t * float option list

(**
   [Tdigest.percentile td p]

   For a percentage [p] ([0..1]) estimate the smallest value [q] at which at least [p] percent of the values [<= q].

   For discrete distributions, this selects q using the Nearest Rank Method
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile#The_Nearest_Rank_method]

   For continuous distributions, interpolates data values between count-weighted bracketing means.

   Returns a new Tdigest to reuse intermediate computations.

val percentile: t -> float -> t * float option

(**
   Same as [Tdigest.percentile] but for a list of values.

   Returns a new Tdigest to reuse intermediate computations.
*)
val percentiles: t -> float list -> t * float option list

(**
   [Tdigest.compress ?delta td]

   Manual recompression. Not guaranteed to reduce size further if too few values have been added since the last compression.

   [delta] (default: initial value passed to [Tdigest.create]) The compression level to use for this operation only. This does not alter the [delta] used by the Tdigest going forward.
*)
val compress: ?delta:delta -> t -> t

(**
   [Tdigest.to_string td]

   Serialize the internal state into a binary string that can be stored or concatenated with other such binary strings.

   Use [Tdigest.of_string] to create a new Tdigest instance from it.

   Returns a new Tdigest to reuse intermediate computations.
*)
val to_string: t -> t * string

(**
   [Tdigest.of_string ?delta ?k ?cx str]

   See [Tdigest.create] for the meaning of the optional parameters.

   Allocate a new Tdigest from a string or concatenation of strings originally created by [Tdigest.to_string].
